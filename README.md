# 2. Before run

## With Makefile

- Run without Docker:

```shell
make l/init
make l/run
```

- Run with Docker:

```shell
make l/init
make l/docker
```

- Run with the tests:

```shell
make l/init
make l/docker
```

## Manually

1. Copy the `.env-example` file to `./pkg/.env` file:

```shell
cp -n .env.example ./pkg/.env
```

2. Create the `logs` directory

```shell
mkdir -p ./pkg/logs
```

## Fill out the variables

- Use your own credentials. If you want to start quickly, these are the default values (do not modify):

```
# Use to initialize the application
GLOBAL_ENV=develop
GLOBAL_LOG_FILE=paack-go.log

# Use for the app (you can change by the AWS secretes storage or by Secrets on GCP)
APP_PORT=8080

# Persistence
FILE_NAME=cities.txt

```
